## Purpose
Tabbed was developed out of necessity. We work with text files from many
different software vendors that create their own idiosyncratic CSV files that we
need to read for machine and deep-learning projects. These files include
different kinds of metadata, unusual headers, and different representions of
"missing" values.  We also found no way to conditionally read rows from files
that are very large.  These considerations motivated us to create Tabbed. If you
find Tabbed useful in your work, please cite Tabbed's paper.
