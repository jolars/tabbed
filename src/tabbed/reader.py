class _Reader(ReprMixin):
    r"""A reader of delimited text files supporting iterative reading of
    specific rows and columns from files that possibly contain metadata and
    header components.

    Most CSV files do not adhere to the RFC-4180 CSV standard. In particular,
    many delimited files contain a metadata section in addition to a header line
    naming the columns of the data. Python's file sniffer can detect dialects
    but it's heuristic rules for detecting the header are limited and exclude
    the possibility of metadata. This reader uses a structural sniffer to detect
    header and metadata sections. Additionally, all delimited text readers to
    date are unable to filter the data by value during reading. This reader can
    selectively read rows of the data using equality, membership, logical
    comparisons, regular expression matching and callable filters. These filters
    can be created using kwargs passed to the tab method. This reader supports
    automatic type conversion to ints, floats, complex numbers, times, dates and
    datetime types. Type conversions errors are gracefully handled by returning
    strings and logging casting errors for review.

    Attributes:
        infile:
            An I/O stream instance returned by open.
        sniffer:
            A tabbed Sniffer instance for dialect & file structure inference.
        dialect:
            The current dialect used by Sniffer. If problems are encountered
            during sniffing, this property may be changed to improve
            detection of header, metadata, and casting types of the Sniffer. The
            dialect parameters that may be changed are; delimiter, escapechar
            and quotechar. Please see the dialect property for a description of
            these parameters.
        header:
            A Header dataclass containing the header line number, the header
            column names, and the row string used to build the column names. If
            the header is not determnined by infile, the line number and row
            string are None type (see tabbed.sniffing module). Attribute changes
            on the embedded sniffer are dynamically reflected in changes to this
            header attribute.
        metadata:
            A frozen dataclass containing the line numbers and metadata string
            from the infile. If not determined from infile the line number is
            None type. Attribute changes on the embedded sniffer are dynamically
            reflected in changes to this metadata attribute.
        typecasts:
            A dictionary of column names and sniffed data types used to convert
            string values from the input file. These types may be overridden in
            the 'read' method for custom type casting.
        tabulator:
            An callable container of tab instances that sequentially applies the
            tabs supplied to the 'tab' method to filter rows and columns of the
            infile during reading. Please type help on the 'tab' method for
            details on how to create tabs using keyword arguments.
        errors:
            A SimpleNamespace instance containing two lists called casting and
            ragged. The casting list is a list of strings indicating the line
            and columns on which casting failed. The ragged list is a list of
            strings indicating the line numbers which have too many or too few
            fields.

            start:
                An integer line number from the start of the file to begin
                reading data. If None and Header has a line number, the line
                following the header line is the start.  If None and header line
                number is None, the line following the metadata section is the
                start. If None and no header line or metadata lines are present,
                the start line will be 0.
            skips:
                A Sequence of integer line numbers to skip during reading.
            indices:
                An optional Sequence of line numbers to read rows from. If None,
                all rows from start not in skips will be read. If reading
                a slice of the file, a range instance will have improved
                performance over other Sequence types.
            chunksize:
                The number of data lines to read at a time. Changing this
                argument to lower values results in lower memory overhead but
                possibly at the expense of runtime. The default is to read
                200,000 lines at a time.
            skip_blanks:
                A boolean indicating if blank lines should be skipped or
                included.
            castings:
                A mapping of column names and types for casting specific columns
                of the data.
            raise_cast:
                A boolean indicating if casting errors should be raised (i.e.
                stop reading) or ignored but logged. On a casting error, this
                reader will gracefully default to string type.
            raise_ragged:
                A boolean indicating if rows with too many or too few cells, as
                compared with the header, should raise an error (i.e. stop
                reading) or be ignored. On a ragged error, this reader will
                gracefully log the error and drop any cells not associated with
                a header column.

        Yields:
            A list of dictionary rows. The number of dicts in each row will be
            chunksize if the number of lines left to read is greater than
            chunksize and smaller otherwise.
