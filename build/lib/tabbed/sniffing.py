class Sniffer(ReprMixin):
    r"""A tool for inferring the dialect and structure of a CSV file.

    The formatting of CSV files can vary widely. Python's builtin Sniffer is
    capable of handling different dialects (separators, line terminators, quotes
    etc) but assumes the first line within the file is a header or a row of
    unheaded data. In practice, many CSV files contain metadata prior to the
    header or data section. While these files are not compliant with CSV
    standards (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180.html), their broad
    use necessitates file sniffing that infers both dialect and structure. To
    date, some csv readers such as Pandas read_csv allow metadata rows to be
    skipped but no formal mechanism for sniffing dialect, metadata and header
    information exist. This Sniffer supports these operations.

    Attributes:
        infile:
            An open file, and instance of IO.
        line_count:
            The number of lines in infile.
        start:
            The start line of infile for collecting a sample of 'amount' number
            of lines.
        amount:
            The number of infile lines to sample for dialect detection and
            locating header and metadata positions. The initial value defaults
            to the smaller of line_count or 100 lines.
        skips:
            Line numbers to ignore during sample collection.

    Example:
        >>> import tempfile
        >>> delimiter = ';'
        >>> # make a metadata and add to text that will be written to tempfile
        >>> metadata = {'exp': '3', 'name': 'Paul Dirac', 'date': '11/09/1942'}
        >>> text = [delimiter.join([key, val]) for key, val in metadata.items()]
        >>> # make a header and row to skip and add to text
        >>> header = delimiter.join('group count color'.split())
        >>> to_skip = delimiter.join('please ignore this line'.split())
        >>> text.extend([header, to_skip])
        >>> # make some data rows and add to text
        >>> group = 'a c b b c a c b c a a c'.split()
        >>> count = '22 2 13 15 4 19 4 21 5 24 18 1'.split()
        >>> color = 'r g b b r r r g g  b b g'.split()
        >>> data = [delimiter.join(row) for row in zip(group, count, color)]
        >>> text.extend(data)
        >>> # create a temp file and dump our text
        >>> outfile = tempfile.TemporaryFile(mode='w+')
        >>> _ = outfile.write('\r\n'.join(text))
        >>> # create a sniffer
        >>> sniffer = Sniffer(outfile)
        >>> # ask sniffer to report number of lines
        >>> sniffer.line_count
        17
        >>> len(text)
        17
        >>> # change the sample amount to 5 lines and skip line 4
        >>> # you would know to do this by inspecting the sample property
        >>> # and seeing the problematic line 4
        >>> sniffer.amount = 5

           contains no items in common with all the rows below it.

        Notes:

               closest to the last row if these rows differ.
            3. If the last sample contains no strings representing numerics,
               take the row closest to the last row that is disjointed with all
               rows below or has a different from last row. If these differ take
               the one closest to last row.

            This heuristic will make mistakes, A judicious choice for the sample
            and skips may improve detection.
